# wptview
Webapp for displaying the results of web-platform-tests.

## Running wptview
This app runs on a local server. You may set up a local server by using Python's SimpleHTTPServer.

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

Go to a browser and visit `localhost:8000`. WPT Viewer should start.

WPT Viewer needs to ingest some web-platform-tests mozlog files to get up and running. A good place to find mozlog files is Mozilla's [Treeherder](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-inbound) for mozilla-inbound.
These files are generally found under "Job Details" after clicking a job having structured logs (such as WPT) as an artifact. The typical name of these files are `testsuite_raw.log`, such as `wpt_raw.log` for the Web Platform Tests.

A good log file to testing purposes may be found [here](http://mozilla-releng-blobs.s3.amazonaws.com/blobs/mozilla-inbound/sha512/05a68f7a1acdd9f9c800e587f576083678588c9271d9221878f3cf959063473bc6783ca09c75eacd39990ac037b0b9ec3c806a8e910c74388609fff1be8fe570).
If you wish to test comparisons, you may use the log files for a recent [w-2](http://mozilla-releng-blobs.s3.amazonaws.com/blobs/mozilla-inbound/sha512/27983329167951b69f6a451846d0c7e422bb0e589c407141737b40ef21f7a8aaf9347bc57928450fff6e64cc86c72970bb0325dbab258b43284a8008cf3e1885) with the [w-e10s-2](http://mozilla-releng-blobs.s3.amazonaws.com/blobs/mozilla-inbound/sha512/d4372303775a5dfeb2d1d7c44d89a2b1dcb78d9ee2e7859fd6469b9a7518594a905a313f0bc947196bebc9a95f153804cd5344471126fd833a56d5498aa9cc5b) run.
